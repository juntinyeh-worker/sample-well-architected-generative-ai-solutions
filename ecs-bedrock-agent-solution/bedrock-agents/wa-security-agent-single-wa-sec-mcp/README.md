# Security Assessment Agent

## 🎯 Purpose
This Bedrock Agent specializes in AWS Well-Architected Security pillar assessments, providing comprehensive security posture evaluation and recommendations.

## 🛡️ **Security Assessment Capabilities**

### Core Security Areas
- **Identity & Access Management**: IAM policies, roles, and permissions analysis
- **Data Protection**: Encryption at rest and in transit evaluation
- **Infrastructure Protection**: Network security and resource isolation
- **Detective Controls**: Logging, monitoring, and incident response
- **Incident Response**: Security event handling and recovery procedures

### Assessment Tools Integration
This agent integrates with the Well-Architected Security MCP Server to access:
- **CheckSecurityServices**: Verify AWS security services status
- **GetSecurityFindings**: Retrieve and analyze security findings
- **CheckStorageEncryption**: Evaluate data-at-rest encryption
- **CheckNetworkSecurity**: Assess network security configurations
- **ListServicesInRegion**: Inventory AWS services for security review
- **GetStoredSecurityContext**: Access historical security assessments
